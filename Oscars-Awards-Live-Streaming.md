Nominations for this year's award ceremony were announced by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences last month and included a broad range of films from the nearly four-hour historical drama, "The Brutalist," to the fantasy musical blockbuster, "Wicked."

Leading the pack for the most nominations is Netflix's crime musical "Emilia Pérez" with 13 Oscar nominations, followed by "The Brutalist" and "Wicked," both of which scored 10 nods each.

The night's biggest prize, best picture, meanwhile, features a stacked lineup including those three plus "Anora," "A Complete Unknown," "Conclave," "I'm Still Here," "The Substance," "Dune: Part Two" and "Nickel Boys."

Who is hosting and performing at the 2025 Oscars? Conan O'Brien will host the 2025 Oscars, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in November.

The telecast will mark the former late-night TV star's first time hosting the film awards ceremony. The comedian has previously hosted the Emmys in 2002 and 2006.

While the Oscars will not have the traditional performances of the tunes nominated for best original song, the night will include performances by Doja Cat, Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Lisa of Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye, doing numbers that according to producers will be "celebrating the filmmaking community and some of its legends."
